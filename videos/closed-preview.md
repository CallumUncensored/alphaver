## Description
 "Damn"
"Don't get me wrong, it's good to have you back, but I'd lie if I said you didn't bring us more questions than answers"

"Though for this one, I have an idea of what's going on"
"There was another preview we made after the first timed demo and it's this one"
"We called it the 'Unrestricted Preview' because it didn't have a timer and had a few more features than the locked down version"
"I'd even go as far as to say it was the most up to date preview we had"

"it needs some kind of key?"
"Oh, right, almost forgot about that. The key is [#####]"

[...]

"Wait what"
"How"
"How did that work"
"That's literally not possible they don't exist anymore"
"The servers are closed"

"Okay, just to be safe I've hidden the key. I'm sure your viewers will be able to figure out how to find it. After all, they've found what I've hidden in the first preview"
