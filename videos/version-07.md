  > 23/09/2010: You all can't behave yourselves. The guidelines clearly state: "You may not distribute the provided software, incl. server software [_]".
  > This rule alone had over 50 violations in the day of release alone when we started the multiplayer test.
  > Because of this, we made the decision to remove the download links to the server software along with manual jar downloads.
  > If you were kicked out of the game with the error message "Session unauthorized", this was the cause.
