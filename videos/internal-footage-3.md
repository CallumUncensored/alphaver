    > Sh: seems to imply that this is an SHA has, but there are sometimes the incorrect number of digits.

    The strings cannot be SHA hashes, as they don't seem to be the correct length, though, it could be just a stripped version of an SHA hash.  
    Either way, this doesn't matter, as even if it is a SHA hash, we can't do anything with them.
