"What the hell is this footage"
"I don't remember we ever had that version code"

"Can you tell me the file date?"

[...]

"But that's

## Characters
* An unknown player

## Anomalies

  * According to the filename, it's called `Smelted Obsidian`.

* 0:46:15: A weird time block that shows the past?
  * The sky suddenly darkens as soon as it enters the view.
  * The path doesn't match what happened previously. This might indicate that it's actually a first-person view of something behind the player.
