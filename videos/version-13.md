## Description
"There it is"
"Though i think it would be better to"
"Upload this one after the E3 one [6] showed us"

"That one will be uploaded later, there's some things I need to check first"
"additionally, you can see in this video one of the bugs that we couldn't fix, the boss music did not play sometimes."



"What I haven't told you yet is that we were the ones that started off [RD]. [RD] was a much bigger project, it was closer to an actual finished game, and [Minecraft] was just their side project that they used to experiment on."

"16.05 was a side branch, which attempted to implement some of [RD]'s ideas."

## Characters
* samurai_2001
* We know this, because the same desktop appears in [Sunrise](sunrise.md), and the player is referred to as `samurai_2001`.

## Anomalies
* An icon on the taskbar appears to have been censored, as it doesn't look like the windows logo
