## Description
"This you, ORBL?"
"Attached video is one of us recording a presentation, to be shown somewhere. The initial plans were E3, but we got rejected after [0] refused to tell them the full company name."
"This was supposed to have subtitles edited in, but seeing what happens in the actual video, this was kept as raw footage"

"While I do have something big to show you, I have to keep low for a while. Some of my past friends like [3] from the art team have already got a hold of me, but I feel that if I'm not careful enough, [0] will too."
