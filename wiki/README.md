# Wiki Site Generator
This script will create a viewable website from the Markdown in this repository. Requires Nodejs to run.

## Usage
To run the site creator, enter the following commands while in the ```/wiki/src``` directory

```
npm install
npm start
```

This should build the site and start a local web server where you can view the wiki webpages. The default port is 8080, and you should be able to view the site by going to ```http://localhost:8080```.
