<h1 id="hunger-mechanics">Hunger Mechanics</h1>
<p>I&#39;m not even sure if I can call this a &quot;hunger mechanic&quot;, it&#39;s more like &quot;take damage out of the blue every once in a while&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="hunger-in-lilypad">Hunger in Lilypad</h2>
<p>&quot;Hunger&quot; in Lilypad is fully implemented.<br>Once the yellow bar is empty, you will take just a little bit of damage.<br>The amount you take is usually regenerated instantly.<br>You cannot refill the bar by eating.<br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/981055480241733672/981055509249531924/Screenshot_20220531-064217_Discord.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="hunger-in-preview-2">Hunger in Preview 2</h2>
<p>&quot;Hunger&quot; in Preview 2 is implemented the same way as in Lilypad.<br>The only exception here is that the UI doesn&#39;t show the time left until you take damage, this way, it may seem like it&#39;s completely random.</p>
