<h1 id="chunk-names-lilypad">Chunk Names (Lilypad)</h1>
<p>In Lilypad, every chunk has a unique name that is assigned to them, these names are also shown in the posted videos.
Turns out, the implementation has some quirks that makes it independent to the world&#39;s seed, with some math and bruteforcing, we can reverse any name to a list of few possible coordinates.</p>
<p>The chunk names mainly consist of two parts, seperated by a dash <em>(-)</em>.<br>There is a chance that there might be no dash, when you are near spawn, in that case, everything is found in the second part.</p>
<p>The parts consist of <a href="syllables.txt">46 (45, excluding <code>TEST</code>) syllables</a>, they are all generated from that list.
Let&#39;s say that the first part of the name consists of 1 syllable, <code>JA</code>. That means that the distance between the current chunk&#39;s coordinates and 0,0 is 3x4¹. This means just with the first part, we already have a super small search space.</p>
<p>The second part of the name always consists of 3 syllables, I basically ported the original generation code over. I&#39;m just bruteforcing it, but the search space is so small that it takes no time to finish.</p>
<p>You should notice that the seed doesn&#39;t come into play when we calculate chunk names. In the original code, the world seed is passed to the name generation method as an argument, but it&#39;s not used in any way. This might be a coding error, or an intentional decision to make searching for coordinates possible.</p>
