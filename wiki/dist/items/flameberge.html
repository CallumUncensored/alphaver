<h2 id="information">Information</h2>
<p>The Flameberge does 4 hearts (8 health) of damage to mobs on hit, as well as the ability to spawn a ring of short-lasting fire upon valid blocks when right-clicking.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-item">Obtaining The Item</h2>
<p>The Flameberge has an 80% chance to drop when killing a <a href="../mobs/LilypadGiant.html">giant</a>.</p>
<h2 id="special-abilities">Special Abilities</h2>
<p>By right-clicking, a hollow 7x7 ring of fire will spawn around player&#39;s feet, centered one block in front of where the player is currently facing. These fire blocks are still dangerous to the player, and last for 2 seconds before extinguishing.</p>
<p>Fire spread and blocks lit or melted as a result of the original flame ring will not extinguish or return to their previous state automatically and will continue to burn as normal. If there are blocks inside of the ring that fire cannot exist upon (i.e. Ice, Glass), the invalid fire blocks will not light, although any valid spaces will still light as expected.</p>
