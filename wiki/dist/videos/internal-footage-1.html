<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>&quot;We paid them [Mojang], so they let us do that, and even gave us access to the auth system. How the project manager pulled it off is beyond me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don&#39;t reveal my name. Chances are, they still know who I am. [...] I&#39;ve also gone ahead and removed all information that could identify me from the video so that you can post it on your channel.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The full version along with some other videos is on my FTP server, I&#39;ve sent you the IP, username and password, check pinned messages. [...] I don&#39;t think I need to say this but DO NOT post these full videos anywhere until I give you the green light.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And what you&#39;re seeing here in this video is me playing. Yes, I know, the focus is all over the place, I didn&#39;t have the best camera at the time. The fact that I even got to record this without being caught is already something, the anti-leaking policy was strict. As for what I do in the video, get real, who wouldn&#39;t screw around with other players&#39; worlds like this, especially back in 2010.&quot;</p>

Unauthorized recording of your assigned computer is not allowed. this should be obvious but some of us have already tried leaking stuff. Don&#39;t do that.

- This list is a TODO, just don&#39;t leak our work.

Reminder: everything that happens in this computer is logged and recorded (this does not count as unauthorized recording, and pointing that out does not make you funny in any way).

Guidelines for recruitment:

1. The recruitment client MUST be set to version 1.0.16_02. If you set it to anything else, you won&#39;t be able to find any candidates and you will be wasting your time.

2. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT run the recruitment client on the development branch. This feature is currently in prototyping phase and will be available once that is over.

3. Do not let your player character be discovered in-game. If you do, signal it to Management and do not attempt to take down any images that make their way onto the internet. leave that work to Management.

4. The candidate needs to be:
  - an active player
  - a player who uses a variety of content from the game
