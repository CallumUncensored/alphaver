<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>&quot;There it is&quot;
&quot;Though i think it would be better to&quot;
&quot;Upload this one after the E3 one [6] showed us&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That one will be uploaded later, there&#39;s some things I need to check first&quot;
&quot;additionally, you can see in this video one of the bugs that we couldn&#39;t fix, the boss music did not play sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What I haven&#39;t told you yet is that we were the ones that started off [RD]. [RD] was a much bigger project, it was closer to an actual finished game, and [Minecraft] was just their side project that they used to experiment on.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;16.05 was a side branch, which attempted to implement some of [RD]&#39;s ideas.&quot;</p>
