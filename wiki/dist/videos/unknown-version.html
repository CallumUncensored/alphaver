<p>&quot;What the hell is this footage&quot;
&quot;I don&#39;t remember we ever had that version code&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can you tell me the file date?&quot;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#39;s
If that&#39;s true, then we had to disband a week prior to this footage
The latest version at the time was version 13
What the hell is going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Take a look&quot;
&quot;At [timestamp]&quot;
&quot;There&#39;s like&quot;
&quot;A black player on top&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay what in the hell
What the hell is a recruiter doing here?
And if that date is correct that would mean
It was recorded when we already fixed the invisible player skins
So there&#39;s no possible way this is [an invasion player]&quot;</p>

<li>Sound can be heard.</li>
</ul>

<li>The player opens chests in a specific order: <code>1, 5, 2, 4, 6 ,3</code></li>
