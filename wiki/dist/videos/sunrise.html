<p>&quot;This was a rare event that [5] and [2] proposed once. [0], as per his policy, wanted them to justify its presence in the game besides cosmetic reasons, so they upped the difficulty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s insensitive of some of you to impersonate someone who&#39;s not with us anymore.&quot;
