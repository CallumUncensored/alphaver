<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>&quot;This, I am pretty sure is the last version to ever exist. While you can see many new features, Lilypad was merely a bugfix release, most notably we fixed a bug with that sorting function that crashed the game often.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for the video itself, it shows [4] testing some of the new features added in version 12. He was a bit late to the party, but at the time he&#39;d been busy with managing our site and bug tracker page.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that&#39;s not a development build, this is what we planned to hand out to the QA team.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speaking of the QA tests, we realised the 2 people from our team weren&#39;t quite enough to test all of the new features. And because we already had a &#39;closed&#39; group of testers, we decided to let anyone who registers via email play it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;what is this name at the top?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s the name of the player&#39;s current area. [0] wanted every group of chunks you visit to feel unique, so that&#39;s what we settled on&quot;</p>
