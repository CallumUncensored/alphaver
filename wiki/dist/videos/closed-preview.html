<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p> &quot;Damn&quot;
&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s good to have you back, but I&#39;d lie if I said you didn&#39;t bring us more questions than answers&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Though for this one, I have an idea of what&#39;s going on&quot;
&quot;There was another preview we made after the first timed demo and it&#39;s this one&quot;
&quot;We called it the &#39;Unrestricted Preview&#39; because it didn&#39;t have a timer and had a few more features than the locked down version&quot;
&quot;I&#39;d even go as far as to say it was the most up to date preview we had&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;it needs some kind of key?&quot;
&quot;Oh, right, almost forgot about that. The key is [#####]&quot;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&quot;Wait what&quot;
&quot;How&quot;
&quot;How did that work&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s literally not possible they don&#39;t exist anymore&quot;
&quot;The servers are closed&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, just to be safe I&#39;ve hidden the key. I&#39;m sure your viewers will be able to figure out how to find it. After all, they&#39;ve found what I&#39;ve hidden in the first preview&quot;</p>
