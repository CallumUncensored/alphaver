<blockquote>
<p>Sh: seems to imply that this is an SHA has, but there are sometimes the incorrect number of digits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The strings cannot be SHA hashes, as they don&#39;t seem to be the correct length, though, it could be just a stripped version of an SHA hash.<br>  Either way, this doesn&#39;t matter, as even if it is a SHA hash, we can&#39;t do anything with them.</p>
