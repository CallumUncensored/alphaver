<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>[22.09.2021]: &quot;I knew it would come to this one time or another. I missed a spot while editing out my personal information. Still, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too late, so please remove the original upload and replace it with this version&quot;</p>
<p>Original description: </p>
<p>&quot;[video attachment] Guess who found the old hard drive. The original version of this video is way longer and has my personal information, which I had to cut out, so that you can put it up on the channel. Oh, and by longer, I mean we&#39;re talking hours. Hours of mostly an empty desktop, don&#39;t really know why he wanted to record the work PCs 24/7. Anyway here&#39;s the original: [link]&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, this video sure brings back memories. It&#39;s a bug-fixing session from 2010. If you look hard enough you can probably find the exact date, don&#39;t really want to check right now, and not that it really matters right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Showing this to you is kind of embarassing, most of this bad code you&#39;re seeing was written by me. But it&#39;s important, seeing that it&#39;s your first, or maybe second look at the work environment back there.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So now all we can do is wait for him to respond, I guess&quot;</p>
