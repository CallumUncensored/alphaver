<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>&quot;[image] This is a hard drive from one of our development PCs. I&#39;m still browsing through everything on it, but for now there&#39;s something I want to show you&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He [0] wanted to pitch the changes to them [Mojang], so he made us create a preview version, and that&#39;s what I found the source code of. Best part? It has no personal details and is not linked to anyone, which means we can post it for everyone to download and try.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The file modified date is showing up as 2021 because I had to recompile the entire thing from scratch&quot;
&quot;Now, don&#39;t expect much. This isn&#39;t a proper jar like the one ORBL found, and because this is a preview, it only has ~25% of the features that were in the final build.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for this video, I think it&#39;s a screen recording of one of us practicing for the &quot;live presentation&quot;. I don&#39;t remember much more, sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We normally had to use a modified launcher, but it seems to run fine under modern MultiMC. To run it, you&#39;ll need to make a new instance of any alpha version, then in its configuration click &quot;Replace Minecraft.jar&quot; and select this one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Enjoy.&quot;</p>
