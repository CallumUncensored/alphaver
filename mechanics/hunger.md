# Hunger Mechanics 
I'm not even sure if I can call this a "hunger mechanic", it's more like "take damage out of the blue every once in a while".

## Hunger in Lilypad
"Hunger" in Lilypad is fully implemented.  
Once the yellow bar is empty, you will take just a little bit of damage.  
The amount you take is usually regenerated instantly.

## Hunger in Preview 2
"Hunger" in Preview 2 is implemented the same way as in Lilypad.  
The only exception here is that the UI doesn't show the time left until you take damage, this way, it may seem like it's completely random.
