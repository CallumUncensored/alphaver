# Milestones (Lilypad)
If you died at least once, you might've noticed that instead of `Score`, you now have `Milestones`.  
Milestones basically indicate how many days you've survived.  
In the `Frail` difficulty, once you reach Milestone 10, it will display a code in the top left corner.  
In a multiplayer game, it will display a different one for each player.
