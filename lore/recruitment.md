# Recruitment program

[Developers](./lore/developers.md) of 16.05 branch wrote additional code and software to perform **the recruitment**. At the time of writing, not much is known about it. All known facts are presented below.

* The recruitment process was performed by [Shadow players](./lore/invasion-players.md), who were called "recruiters".
* The recruiters joined usual players' (were called "candidates") worlds and oversaw their gameplay.
* They could accept or decline the candidates through the "Recruitment client"[^1], but it is not known what would happen in any of these cases.
* The recruiters used version Alpha 1.0.16_02 until the proper tools for recruitment were developed for the 16.05 versions.
* The recruitment program continued after the developer team got disbanded[^2].
* The recruiters ability of joining the players' worlds inspired developers to create [the Hub](./lore/hub.md).
* It is unclear what was the exact goal of the program, but it's most likely that this was how developers had got playtesters for the 16.05 branch, although there's no evidence to support this theory.
