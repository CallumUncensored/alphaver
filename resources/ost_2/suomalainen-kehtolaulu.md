# Suomalainen Kehtolaulu
> aka: `1-Suomalainen Kehtolaulu.ogg`

File comment:
> Composer's Note: This track was highly experimental, and was supposed to be played on a record that would be given to the player at the start of the game, almost like a medley, although now that was never implemented, so it works like any other record track, though the length never changed
